### Fighting Style

You gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

**Great Weapon Fighting.** When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit.

### Second Wind

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a Bonus Action, you can use it to regain Hit Points equal to 1d10 plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Weapon Mastery

Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

## 2nd Level

### Action Surge

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the Magic action.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

### Tactical Mind

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining Hit Points, you roll 1d10 and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn’t expended.

## 3rd Level

**Fighter Subclass**: Knight of North Gumbia

### Ready at a Moment's Notice

Starting at level 3, when you select this subclass, your senses and battlefield awareness have become sharpened to a pristine edge as you are always on the lookout for danger. You cannot be surprised and you may add your Constitution Modifier to your initiative rolls.

### Gumbian Shield

Starting at level 3, you are practiced in leaping to the aid of your allies and protecting them from harm. During your turn, you may spend a bonus action to designate one ally within sight as your Ward. If your ward is attacked, you may use your reaction to move your speed and take the damage from the attack. This may be activated after a hit is declared but before damage is rolled. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.

## 4th Level

### Ability Score Increase

Strength +2

## 5th Level

### Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Tactical Shift

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a Bonus Action, you can move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

## 6th Level

### Ability Score Increase

Strength +1
Constitution +1
