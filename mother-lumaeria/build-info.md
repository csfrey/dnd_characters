### 1ST LEVEL

**Healer** (feat) - You have the training and intuition to administer first aid and other care effectively, granting you the following benefits:

- _Battle Medic_. If you have a Healer’s Kit, you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature
  within 5 feet of you as an Action. That creature can expend one of its Hit Dice, and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Proficiency Bonus.
- _Healing Rerolls_. Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of Hit Points you restore with a spell or with this feat’s Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.

**Bardic Inspiration** - You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a d6.

- As a Bonus Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it’s rolled.
- You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
- Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

**Spellcasting** - You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list.

- You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list. When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features table.
- The Bard Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
- Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell slots.
- Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.
- You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

### 2ND LEVEL

**Expertise** - You gain Expertise in two of your skill proficiencies of your choice.

**Jack of All Trades** - You can add half your Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) to any ability check you make that uses a skill proficiency you lack and that doesn’t otherwise use your Proficiency Bonus.

### 3RD LEVEL

**Beguiling Magic** -You always have the Charm Person and Mirror Image spells prepared.

In addition, immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell, you can cause a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself to make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spell Save DC. On a failed save, the target has the Charmed or Frightened condition (your choice) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once you use this benefit, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of the feature by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration (no action required).

**Mantle of Inspiration** - You can weave fey magic into a song or dance to fill others with vigor. As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die. When you do so, choose a number of other creatures within 60 feet of yourself, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of them gains a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 2 times the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die, and then each of them can use its Reaction to move up to its Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

### 4TH LEVEL

**Metamagic Adept** - You've learned how to exert your will on your spells to alter how they function:

- You learn two Metamagic options of your choice from the sorcerer class. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless the option says otherwise. Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one of these Metamagic options with another one from the sorcerer class.
- You gain 2 sorcery points to spend on Metamagic (these points are added to any sorcery points you have from another source but can be used only on Metamagic). You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
- Choices: Subtle Spell, Distant Spell

### 5TH LEVEL

**Font of Inspiration** - You now also regain all your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a Short Rest. In addition, you can expend a spell slot (no action required) to regain one expended use of Bardic Inspiration.

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a Bonus Action on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within range.
If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 2.

# Story

## Backstory

Mother Lumaeria was born - or rather hatched - in a nest high up in a tree, left to the mercy of the elements. Luckily, a group of adventurers stumbled upon her nest and found the abandoned hatchling inside. They took her to a nearby orphanage, where she was delivered into the care of the matron who ran the establishment.

Growing up in the orphanage, Lumaeria never found a family to call her own. When she turned 18, she aged out of the system and left to find her own way in the world. She tried her hand at odd jobs around town, but it wasn't long before she found herself working in the brothel owned by the same woman who had run the orphanage. The Madam saw potential in Lumaeria and gave her a chance to earn a living there.

Lumaeria worked hard and eventually rose through the ranks, becoming one of the senior employees at the brothel. When the Madam retired, Lumaeria took over as the new operator. She saved up her earnings and formed relationships with local bigwigs, striking a deal with some pioneers to start a new town closer to the Gulch, away from the authoritarian government of the East, where she would own and run her own brothel.

Business was booming, and the town was growing. Lumaeria was an upstanding businesswoman, registered to all the required guilds and authorities, including MAG. She was well-known for her lively performances at the bar, singing and dancing for the customers. She was even deputized by the sheriff to take care of any unruly customers.

Lumaeria was fiercely protective of all her employees, treating them like family. Her beauty was well-known throughout the town, and she was often compared to the Secretary Birds that roamed the wilds. Her hair was white with black stripes, just like a secretary bird, and her feathers were earthy colors like white, brown, and orange.

However, when the magic from the Gulch started seeping out and causing problems, business slowed down. People started leaving the town as the problems got worse, until it was basically just Lumaeria, the sheriff, and the mayor. Even most of her girls had left to work at other brothels in other towns.

Seeing that the town had collapsed and her business had failed, Lumaeria packed up her things along with her pride and hit the road. Her journey brought her West of the Gulch to a small town called Las Amantes, where she went looking for a familiar face and a new beginning.
