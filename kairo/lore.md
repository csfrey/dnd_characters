# City of Lúnathalas

Hidden deep within the vibrant and ever-changing forests of the Feywild, the city of Lúnathalas is a shimmering example of elven elegance and harmony with nature. Lúnathalas is not built upon the land but within it, its architecture entwining with the trees, rivers, and rocks of the forest. Every building is woven from living branches, their trunks bending and growing to form graceful arches, walls, and platforms. The city shifts and changes with the seasons, just like the Feywild itself, ensuring that no two visits to Lúnathalas are ever quite the same.

## Geography and Layout

Lúnathalas is spread across a dense forest known as the Silverbark Grove, where the trees glow with a faint silver light, casting an ethereal glow upon the city. The trees are enormous, with trunks wide enough to house entire families within their hollowed centers and branches that create natural bridges between sections of the city. Some parts of the city rise high into the treetops, while others nestle along the forest floor, connected by spiraling stairways made from thick vines.

At the heart of Lúnathalas lies the Moonwell, a pool of silver water that pulses with the rhythm of the Feywild itself. It is said that the Moonwell is the source of the city's magic and that the elves who bathe in its waters gain foresight into future events or the ability to travel across the Feywild's ever-shifting paths. Around the Moonwell stands the Council of Elders' Hall, a grand living structure formed by the intertwining roots of ancient trees.

## Significant Landmarks

### The Shifting Bazaar

A marketplace that appears in different locations throughout the city depending on the whims of the Feywild. Merchants here sell all manner of enchanted goods, exotic plants, and curious artifacts from across the planes. It's a place where deals are often sealed with riddles or games of chance rather than gold.

### The Silverbark Grove

The towering forest surrounding the city is both a place of wonder and danger. The trees here have been known to move, and strange creatures from across the Feywild often wander through. It is said that time flows differently in the Silverbark Grove, and travelers must always be cautious not to stray too far from the city’s boundaries.

### The Eternal Arboretum

A vast, magical garden maintained by the city’s druids, filled with plants that are unique to the Feywild. Each species has its own magical properties, and many of the city's herbalists and potion-makers source their ingredients here. Some sections of the Arboretum are said to be cursed, harboring plants that trap unwary visitors in dreams.

### The Veil of Winds

A mystical curtain of shimmering air that marks the boundary between Lúnathalas and the deeper, wilder parts of the Feywild. Passing through the Veil of Winds without the guidance of a Warden or druid can lead travelers to other realms or deep into the Feywild’s chaotic heart, where the laws of nature and reality no longer hold.

## Fey Connections

Being situated in the Feywild, Lúnathalas has strong ties to the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. While the city maintains a neutral stance, individual elves often have personal alliances with Fey nobles. The politics of these courts sometimes spill into the city, causing tension or intrigue. Fey creatures, from pixies to powerful archfey, are common visitors, and their presence often adds an additional layer of unpredictability to life in the city.

## Culture and Society

The elves of Lúnathalas are deeply attuned to the Feywild’s chaotic nature. Their society values adaptability, creativity, and a deep connection to both magic and nature. Elves here believe that life is a dance between stability and change, and they embrace the unpredictability of their world. Their art, music, and poetry reflect this, often incorporating themes of transformation, illusions, and the passage of time.

Magic is woven into everyday life in Lúnathalas, with many of the city's inhabitants practicing arcane arts or maintaining bonds with powerful Fey beings. The Wardens of the Silverbark, a prestigious group of druids and rangers, protect the city from the wild creatures that roam the Feywild and ensure that Lúnathalas remains in harmony with its surroundings.

The city is ruled by the Council of Elders, a group of long-lived elven leaders who each represent a different aspect of Feywild life: nature, magic, trade, and defense. While the council governs through consensus, the unpredictable nature of the Feywild often leads to spontaneous decisions and shifts in policy as the city adapts to new challenges.

Education in Lúnathalas is deeply integrated with the natural rhythms of the Feywild, emphasizing a holistic approach that blends magic, nature, and personal growth. Formal schooling is less structured than in many other societies, with children and young elves learning through a mix of mentorship and hands-on experiences rather than rigid classrooms. Elders, druids, and wizards serve as teachers, guiding students through the study of arcane magic, druidic traditions, and Feywild lore. Lessons are often taught in small groups within the living structures of the city or out in the Silverbark Grove, where the ever-changing environment provides dynamic learning opportunities. Students are encouraged to forge their own paths of discovery, with an emphasis on adaptability, creative thinking, and deepening their personal connection to the Feywild.

# The University of California, San Astra

The University of California, San Astra, stands as a prestigious institution situated at the intersection of the mundane and magical worlds. Nestled atop the leyline crossroads that power the city of San Astra, the university is renowned not only for its academic excellence but also for its deep integration with the magical energies that flow beneath the city. It offers a unique blend of traditional education and arcane studies, attracting students from across the Material Plane, and even some from beyond.

## Campus and Layout

The UCSA campus is a sprawling combination of ancient architecture and cutting-edge facilities. Gothic-style lecture halls made of marble and enchanted wood stand alongside modern laboratories, art studios, and arcane research centers. The most iconic building is Ley Hall, built directly over one of the most potent leyline nodes. Its central dome radiates an ethereal glow and is home to the university's top magical research programs.

Hidden from mundane eyes by The Blindness, much of the campus operates in both visible and magical dimensions. Non-magical students see a prestigious university with state-of-the-art facilities, while magical students access a world layered with arcane energy, revealing secret paths, hidden libraries, and entire departments that only those attuned to magic can see.

## Academic Focus and Programs

UCSA offers a diverse range of programs, from traditional subjects such as Engineering, Literature, and Economics, to more esoteric disciplines like Rune Theory, Psionics, and Feywild Ecology. The university prides itself on allowing students to explore both mundane and magical subjects simultaneously, fostering innovation at the crossroads of technology and magic. Its most distinguished programs include:

- **Arcane Engineering:** A hybrid of mechanical engineering and magical theory, this program teaches students to craft devices and tools that harness leyline energy, allowing for the seamless integration of magic into everyday life.
- **Psionics Department:** One of the university’s most exclusive programs, specializing in the study of innate mental powers. Kai’rō would have spent much of his time here, refining his abilities under the mentorship of psionically-gifted professors.
- **Magical Arts and Culture:** A program focused on the intersection of art, culture, and magic, delving into how magic influences art forms and how societies adapt to living with arcane power.
- **Interplanar Studies:** A highly-regarded program that explores the physics and metaphysics of traveling between planes of existence, with a focus on the Feywild, Shadowfell, and Elemental Planes.

## Student Life and Culture

Student life at UCSA is as vibrant and diverse as the city itself. Clubs and organizations cater to every interest, from mundane sports teams to arcane dueling societies. The Magical Debate Club is a notable fixture on campus, where students debate magical theory, often using spells and illusions to make their arguments. There is also a thriving creative scene, with enchanted music performances, exhibitions of living art, and theater shows that transcend ordinary reality.

The student body is a mix of mundane humans and magical beings, resulting in a unique cultural fusion. The Blindness keeps most mundane students unaware of their magical peers, but those in the know form tight-knit communities within the university. The Planar Exchange Program is especially popular, allowing magical students to spend time in other planes—such as the Feywild or the Elemental Plane of Air—and even return to their home plane for special projects.

## Key Landmarks

### Ardent Hall

Named after Dr. Maren Ardent, this is the heart of magical research on campus, its walls hum with leyline energy. Inside, students and faculty conduct cutting-edge research on leyline manipulation, arcane energy conversion, and time-space distortions.

Dr. Maren Ardent was an enigmatic and brilliant mage-scholar who was instrumental in uncovering the deeper mysteries of leyline energy in San Astra. Known for her fiery passion and relentless pursuit of knowledge, Ardent pushed the boundaries of arcane science, developing the first practical applications of leyline magic for urban infrastructure. Her groundbreaking work allowed for the creation of the arcane grid that powers both the magical and mundane parts of San Astra. Dr. Ardent also had a reputation for being intensely private, rarely appearing in public except for her lectures, which were known for their complexity and intensity. Ardent Hall, built in her honor, stands as the core of magical research at UCSA, housing not only leyline studies but also advanced arcane engineering.

### Theodric Quill Library

Named after a wealthy alumnus of the university, the library is one of the most remarkable features of the UCSA campus, a place where mundane knowledge and arcane secrets blend seamlessly. The library is an imposing structure of towering marble columns and enchanted wood, its exterior blending classic university architecture with shimmering, otherworldly symbols carved into its walls. The building itself feels alive—books seem to shift on the shelves as you walk by, and hallways occasionally reconfigure themselves, revealing hidden rooms to those who know how to look.

Unlike many other buildings on campus, Quill Library is fully visible to both magical and non-magical students, though what they perceive differs. Mundane students see a vast, highly sophisticated university library filled with academic journals, tomes, and research materials, while magical students and faculty can access entire wings dedicated to arcane research. The library is heavily warded, ensuring that dangerous magical texts are kept safely under lock and spell. Those attuned to magic will find entire hidden floors, and certain books can only be accessed by passing magical trials designed to test the reader's worthiness.

### Raina Valis Hall

Named after the founder of UCSA's Psionics Department, Valis Hall is the center of UCSA’s Psionics Department, named after the legendary psionic master who founded it. The building’s sleek, minimalist design reflects the discipline and focus required for mastering psionics, a rare and demanding field. Inside, students learn psionic theory in quiet, distraction-free lecture halls, practice their abilities in state-of-the-art labs equipped with advanced technology, and undergo intensive mental training in private chambers. The hall also houses the Vault of Minds, a secure repository for ancient psionic artifacts and the personal research of Raina Valis herself. It stands as a place of deep study and growth for psionically-gifted students who push the limits of their mental powers under the guidance of expert mentors.

### Runefield Stadium

UCSA’s premier venue for both mundane and magical sports, named after the renowned athlete and warrior-mage Eldrin Runefield. The stadium’s design blends traditional sports architecture with arcane enhancements, featuring a massive arena where mundane events like soccer and football take place alongside magical competitions. Arcane dueling, enchanted obstacle courses, and spellcasting tournaments are common fixtures, drawing large crowds of both magical and non-magical students. The stadium’s enchanted field can shift and adapt to various types of games, creating dynamic environments that challenge players' physical and magical abilities. Runefield Stadium is a central hub of campus life, where students of all backgrounds come together to compete, cheer, and celebrate the unique blend of athletics and magic that defines UCSA.
