### Researcher

When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you do not know that information, you often know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.

## Equipment

- a briefcase
- school supplies
- small wallet with ID, debit card, and a bit of cash
- small survival knife

### Brooch of the Hidden Word

_Wondrous item (very rare, requires attunement by a talent)_

As an action, you can forge a telepathic link with another willing creature within 30 feet of you. You and the creature can then communicate telepathically with each other through the bond, whether you share a common language or not. Once this link is established, communication is possible over any distance so long as you are on the same plane as the other creature. The link ends if one or both creatures becomes incapacitated or dies, if the owner severs the connection, or if the link is blocked by some psionic means.

**_Level Scaling._** At 1st level you can forge a telepathic link with up to one creature. This limit increases to two creatures at 11th level, and three creatures at 17th level.

## Talent - Pyrokinetic

### 1st Level

#### Psionic Powers

With you psionic potential awakened, you can manifest powers through sheer force of will.

**Manifestation Ability.** Intelligence is your manifestation ability. Your Power save DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your intelligence modifier.

**Strain.** Manifesting psionic powers can put a stress on a manifester's body, mind, and soul. If your strain ever exceeds your strain maximum, you die. If you are returned to life after dying as a result of gaining strain, you return to life with strain equal to your strain maximum. Your strain maximum increases as you gain talent levels.

#### Strain to Maintain

Whenever you fail a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on one or more powers you gain from this class, you can gain strain to keep all the powers you are concentrating on active. This strain is equal to the sum of the order of those powers.

### 2nd Level

#### Psionic Specialization - Pyrokinetic

**Flame On.** As an action, you psionically create a ball of flame that appears on your body. The flame harms neither you nor your equipment, and sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can create only one flame at a time in this way.

As part of the action used to create the flame, or as an action if you created the flame previously, you can make a melee or ranged power attack with it. If you make a ranged attack, you can hurl the flame at a target up to 60 feet away from you. On a hit, the target takes fire damage equal to 1d6+INT (min. +1). Any flammable object hit by the flame ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

The flame lasts until you make an attack with it or dismiss it (no action required). If you become incapacitated, the flame disappears.

As you reach higher levels in this class, this feature allows you to create more than one flame. When you attack while holding multiple flames, you do so with all of them at once, making separate attack rolls for each flame and directing them at one target or several. You can create two flames at 5th level, three flames at 11th level, and four flames at 17 level.

**Pyrokinesis Adept.** When you roll a manifestation die to learn a pyrokinesis power, you can roll the die twice and use either roll.

In addition, after you make a manifestation test to manifest a pyrokinesis power, you can reroll the manifestation die and use either roll. You can reroll a number of manifestation tests equal to you Intelligence modifier (min. 1), regaining all uses when you finish a long rest. You can use this feature only once for a single manifestation test.

### 3rd Level

#### Psionic Exertion

You can expend your energy to give your powers an extra effect. You gain one Psionic Exertion option of your choice. You gain additional options at 7th, 11th, and 15th level. You can only use one Psionic Exertion option on a power when you manifest it.

**Halting Power.** When a Medium or smaller creature fails a saving throw against a power you manifest, you can gain 2 strain to make the target restrained until the start of your next turn. You can gain 4 strain to affect a Large creature with this Psionic Exertion option.

**Overwhelming Power.** When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against a power you manifest, you can gain strain equal to the power's order to force the creature to reroll the saving throw with a penalty equal to your proficiency bonus. The creature must use the new roll.

**Shared Power.** After you make a manifestation test to manifest a power that can target only one creature and doesn’t create an
area of effect, you can gain strain equal to the power’s order to target a second creature in range with the same power.

### 4th Level

#### Ability Score Improvement.

Intelligence +2.

### 5th level

#### 3rd-Order Powers

You gain two 3rd-order powers.

#### Manifestation Die Improvement

### 6th level

#### Bend Flame

Whenever you manifest a pyrokinesis power, you can pick one of the following options:

- Change any fire damage dealt by the power to force damage
- Choose a number of creatures equal to the power's order. The choses creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws againstg the power, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

### 7th level

#### Psychic Boost

You can use a bonus action to remove strain equal to your proficiency bonus. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

You can use this feature twice between long rests starting at 12th level, and three times between rests starting at 17th level.

### 8th level

#### Ability Score Improvement.

Intelligence +1, Constitution +1

### 9th level

#### 4th-Order Powers

You gain two 4th-order powers.

### 10th level

#### Heat Seeking

### 11th level

#### Psionic Bastion

You can't be charmed or frightened, and magic psionics can't put you to sleep. Additionally, you have resistance to psychic damage.

### 12th level

#### Feat: Better Under Pressure

Whenever you gain strain, you also gain 1 pressure point for each strain you gain this way. Thereafter, whenever you make a D20 test, you can spend up to 3 pressure points and add 1 to the roll for each point spent. You can wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to spend pressure points. You lose all your pressure points when you finish a long rest.
